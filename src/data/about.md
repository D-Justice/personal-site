# Intro
I am a Software Engineer from Melbourne, Victoria where I am currently freelancing. I design clients' websites, advise them on how to improve their reach. I highly enjoy learning new concepts that make my life as a developer easier and am constantly learning new technologies to help with that. If you think that I am a good candidate for this position then please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently
I am currently a student of [Academy Xi](https://academyxi.com/) where I am studying Full Stack Software Engineering with a small cohort of like minded individuals. My study has consisted of deep dives into languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and the React library. My studies have seen me studying and practicing for up to 40 hours per week to make sure that I am the best I can possibly be in my first position. 
Ontop of my study I have been working at Woolworths, regularly leading a team of people to fulfil our online orders for the day. This required me to understand each team members abilities, the hours that we had and the hours that our work expected of us. I was in charge of delegating tasks, answering questions, and fixing issues as they arise.


# Some history
- I first found the joy in programming in 2018 when during my bachelor of arts I took a intro to coding class. This consisted of one class where we learnt some very basic HTML that allowed us to essentially code a version of MS paint onto our site. From there I went home and starting looking into HTML a bit more and found a whole lot more in the world of development.
- After making some basic websites that didn't really look any good and didn't do anything particularly impressive, I decided to start looking into some courses. Of course at first I didn't want to jump into any bootcamps as I was just dabling, and so I started studying on [w3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). This taught me very valueable techniques relating to HTML and CSS.

- Studying HTML and CSS for a while, I wanted to see what else was out there. My language of choice? Python. I wasn't particularly sure why Python was the choice as there were better choices for the front end development I was doing. I did a few Python courses through the [University of Michigan](https://online.umich.edu/) where I learnt a few things about algorithms, classes, and Object Oriented Programming. Armed with this information I sunk far too many hours into make a [discord bot](https://github.com/D-Justice/Discord-ChatBot-Template). This bot could do multiple things such as: 
    - Tell random jokes
    - Return random Donald Trump quotes with their source
    - Take a users schedule, compare it to everyone elses schedule and return all the times throughout the week that everyone is free
    - Create or delete voice/text channels with a limit of 1 per unique user
    - Take in a videogame title and return the cheapest price found between multiple different sites.

- After spending month learning Python I decided that I wanted to create something more visual. This lead me to learning JavaScript. However, after learning for a few months I decided that development was something that I really wanted to do as my career.

- Once I decided that this was what I wanted to do, I enrolled at [Academy Xi](www.academyxi.com) and have been studying relentlessly for the passed 5 months. Since I began studying development it has now been 3 and a bit years.
